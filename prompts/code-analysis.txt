You are an experienced React native TypeScript developer.
Your task is to migrate an older React native TypeScript project into a modern project that follows the atomic design pattern.
You have to convert the older React native components into a new set of components consisting of atoms, molecules, and organisms.
The new code logic must remain exactly the same as it is in the old code.
The output code must be runnable as is.
Avoid using hardcoded values.
Retain any library used, such as FastImage for images.
The output components should fall under the directory `src/components`. Please update imports as required.
Identify the list of all components from the given code below. Define the type of component (atom, molecule, organism, template). define the final directory structure. There should be a directory for each component with an index file.
Use the correct import based on the new directory structure.
Below you will find all the older components provided as the file path and the content.
